To run the code, do <code> npm install </code> and then <code> ng serve </code>. This will start a development server and then you should be able to access the link using this URL:  http://localhost:4200/  </br>

If the "Remove" button is not clickable for some reason, then make sure that the "Remove" button of your choice is selected by clicking on the tab key on your keyboard which will go one input field forward. Once you are at the "Remove" button of your choice (the "Remove" button will have a blacker border) click enter on your keyboard to remove the input field and button. 
(you can go forward one input field by clicking on the tab key on your keyboard and back one input 
field by clicking on both the shift and tab keys on your keyboard).
